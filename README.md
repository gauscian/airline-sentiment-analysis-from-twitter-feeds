1. What is sentiment analysis ? Why does it make sense to extract sentiment from tweets ?
2. Is it possible me to get the sentiment from the text without getting into psycholinguistics ?
3. How can you apply machine learning on text given that majority of the ML algorithms work with numerical data ?

This set of questions is a great starting point for atleast getting you started with sentiment analysis.

###  1. What is sentiment analysis ? Why does it make sense to extract sentiment from tweets ?
> *Sentiment Analysis* here, in this context, can be defined as the complete paradigm of automating the procedure of analyzing the sentiment from text. After you have a labelled data set, the task of sentiment analysis can be broken down into following subtasks -
> 1. Coming up (or using one of the established ones) with a  technique for mapping the textual data into numbers or vectors. For instance TF(Term Frequency)-IDF(Inverted Document Frequency) vectors.
